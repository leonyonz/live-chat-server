# Creating Admin Users

This feature is not yet developed. Please check back in a future release.

The Live Chat Server will provide secure methods for creating administrator users including:
- Command-line interface for creating admin accounts
- Web-based admin user creation (for existing admins)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Secure password requirements and hashing

For current admin user creation capabilities, please refer to the [Admin Dashboard Guide](Admin-Dashboard-Guide.md) or check the [Changelog](Changelog.md) for implemented features.
